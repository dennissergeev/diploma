\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Victor Stepanenko for constructive feedback, and help when needed.
Further thanks goes to Michail Kurgansky and Thomas Spengler, and NERSC.

Finally, a big thanks goes to my fellow students of the past five years, for making it five good years.
